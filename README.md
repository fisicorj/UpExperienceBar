# UpExperienceBar

Overview
--------

This addon keeps your Experience Bar there, permanently.

It is based on the addon from https://github.com/alexgurrola/PermanentExperienceBar.

Usage
-------

Simply install the addon and the Experience Bar will remain in the top left corner of the UI.  If you want to fiddle with the internals, there is a `/expbar` command with a few options.
